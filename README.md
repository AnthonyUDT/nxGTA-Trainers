# nxGTA-Trainers
This is a set of tools for cheating in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition for the Nintendo Switch.

*While I will try to provide cheats for all 3 games, my primary focus is San Andreas! If there's a cheat for one game that you want
in the other, please let me know!!*
## You can find cheats such as: 
* Editing Money, Time, and Player Stats.
* Adjusting Shaders
* Adjusting Physics
* Infinite Health
* Spawning Special Cars
* and much more!

*The list of cheats yet to come may change, right now everything is just in it's planning phase. No code is guaranteed to be made.*

## Usage:
* Place III.ovl, ViceCity.ovl and SanAndreas.ovl in sd:/switch/.overlays.
* Launch the game you want to play, and then open the cheat menu by pressing L+DpadDown+RStick and selecting the right trainer for your game.

## Building:
(Devkitpro is required to build these menus)
* Download the files and place them somewhere on your computer.
* Grab libtesla from [here](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Template), paste the libs folder in the root src of the menu you want to build.
* Download the atmosphere libs from [here](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere-libs).
* Create a folder in the src root of your chosen menu, and name it 'Atmosphere-libs', paste the atmosphere files and folders you downloaded from the link above
into the newly created folder.
* Run "build.bat", and let it finish. Tadaaa, you're done!
